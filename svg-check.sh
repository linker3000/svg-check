# This bash script parses svg files for known issues that prevent
# the files being imported in yEd as icons
#
# syntax ./svg-check svgfilename.svg
#
# The script will create a subfolder called svgout and the output file/s
# will be put in there. Existing file swith matching names will be 
# overwritten.
#
# To use this script to process multiple files, try:
#
# find . -maxdepth 1 -name "*.svg" -exec ./svg-check.sh '{}' \;
